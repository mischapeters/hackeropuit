# HackErOpUit

An overview of hacker-events in and around the Netherlands

Patches welcome ;) (Both in the code as with new events)

## Contributing:

## Example event data:

```yaml
- Name: Event Name/Title
  Location: City, Country
  StartDate: 2022-07-22
  EndDate: 2022-07-26
  Comment: Something optional
  URL: https://hackeropuit.nl
```

If no date is known yet, just put in an approximate date, but have the end-date be before the start-date, so the entry will be ignored and not printed in the table.
